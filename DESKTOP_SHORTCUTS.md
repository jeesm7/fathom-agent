## 🔧 What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you double-click either shortcut:

1. **Checks** if http://localhost:3000 is running
2. **If NOT running**:
   - Opens Terminal
   - Navigates to your project
   - Runs `npm run dev`
   - Waits 5 seconds for startup
3. **Opens** your browser to the dashboard
4. **Done!** ✨

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Keep Server Running
- Start server once: `npm run dev` in Terminal
- Use shortcuts anytime to open browser
- No waiting for server startup!

### Dock Organization
Drag these to your Dock:
1. "Fathom Agent.app" - Opens the dashboard
2. Terminal - For running `npm run dev`
3. Your browser - For quick access

### Keyboard Maestro / Alfred
You can also create global keyboard shortcuts that run:
```bash
open -a "Fathom Agent"
```
