2. Click "Create vector store"
3. Name it "Fathom Agent Examples"
4. Click "Create"
5. **Copy the Vector Store ID** (starts with `vs_`)

## Step 4: Set Up Google Drive Folders

3. For each folder, get the ID:
   - Open the folder
   - Look at the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID_HERE`
   - Copy the `FOLDER_ID_HERE` part

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:

```env
# Generate a random secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# From Google Cloud Console (Step 2.4)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# Your email (must match Google account)
GOOGLE_ALLOWED_EMAILS_CSV=your.email@example.com

# From OpenAI (Step 3)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_ID=vs_...

# From Google Drive (Step 4)
PROPOSALS_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1a2b3c4d5e...
LEGAL_RESEARCH_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1f2g3h4i5j...
SERVICE_AGREEMENTS_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1k2l3m4n5o...
SCOPE_OF_WORK_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1p2q3r4s5t...
RESEARCH_ATTACHMENTS_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1u2v3w4x5y...

# Fathom (generate a random secret)
FATHOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Redis (default for local)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Database (default for local SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
```

## Step 6: Set Up Database

```bash
# Run migrations and seed default prompts
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Create the SQLite database
- Run all migrations
- Seed 5 default prompt templates

## Step 7: Start Redis

### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew services start redis
```

### Linux
```bash
sudo systemctl start redis
```

### Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

### Verify Redis is running
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

## Step 8: Start the Application

Open **3 terminal windows**:

### Terminal 1 - Next.js App
```bash
npm run dev
```
Wait for "Ready" message, then open http://localhost:3000

### Terminal 2 - BullMQ Worker
```bash
npm run worker
```
Should show "Starting BullMQ workers..." and "Meeting worker started"

### Terminal 3 - Prisma Studio (Optional)
```bash
npm run db:studio
```
Opens database viewer at http://localhost:5555

## Step 9: First Sign In

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Select your Google account
4. Review permissions and click "Allow"
5. You should be redirected to the Dashboard

**If you get an access denied error:**
- Check that your email is in `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_EMAILS_CSV`
- Restart the dev server

## Step 10: Test the System

### Option A: Quick Test Run

1. In the Dashboard, find "Quick Test Run"
2. Enter a meeting title: "Test Discovery Call"
3. Paste this sample transcript:

```
John: Hi Sarah, thanks for meeting with me today. I'd like to discuss our data compliance requirements.

Sarah: Of course! What specifically are you concerned about?

John: We're launching a new SMS campaign and want to make sure we're TCPA compliant. We'll be using an autodialer system.

Sarah: That's a great concern. TCPA regulations are strict about autodialers. You'll need express written consent from recipients, and you must honor opt-out requests immediately.

John: Got it. We also need a formal proposal with pricing for your consulting services. Can you help us draft a compliance policy?

Sarah: Absolutely. I can prepare a comprehensive proposal including legal research on TCPA requirements, a service agreement, and a detailed scope of work for the compliance policy creation.

John: Perfect. What's your availability for next steps?

Sarah: I'll send you a follow-up email with all the documents by end of week.
```

4. Click "Run Test"
5. Go to **Logs** page to watch processing
6. When complete, you'll see generated documents with links

### Option B: Configure Fathom Webhook

1. Log in to Fathom
2. Go to Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
3. Add a new webhook:
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/fathom` (or use ngrok for testing)
   - Event: "New meeting content ready"
   - Secret: (copy from your `.env` FATHOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
4. Have a meeting in Fathom
5. Watch the webhook trigger automatically

## Step 11: Customize Prompts

1. Go to **Prompts** page
2. Click "Edit" on any prompt template
3. Modify the system or user template
4. Adjust temperature, top_p, max_tokens
5. Click "Save"
6. Run another test to see the changes

## Step 12: Upload Example Documents

1. Go to **Examples** page
2. Enter a title: "Q4 2024 Proposal Template"
3. Select document type: "Proposal"
4. Upload a PDF or DOCX file
5. Click "Upload to Vector Store"
6. The AI will now use this as a style reference

## Troubleshooting

### "Redis connection failed"
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# If not, start it
brew services start redis  # macOS
sudo systemctl start redis # Linux
```

### "Unauthorized" error on sign in
- Check `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_EMAILS_CSV` matches your Google email exactly
- Restart dev server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`

### Worker not processing jobs
- Check Terminal 2 for errors
- Verify Redis is running
- Check BullMQ queue: `redis-cli` â†’ `KEYS bull:meeting:*`

### Google API errors
- Verify all APIs are enabled in Cloud Console
- Check OAuth redirect URI matches exactly
- Ensure scopes are added to OAuth consent screen
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting in Settings

### No documents generated
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify Drive folder IDs are correct
- Check worker logs for errors
- Try viewing in Prisma Studio to see job status

## Next Steps

### In Production

1. **Deploy to hosting platform** (Vercel, Railway, Render)
2. **Add Postgres database** (update `DATABASE_URL`)
3. **Use Redis cloud service** (update `REDIS_URL`)
4. **Add production OAuth redirect** in Google Console
5. **Update environment variables** in hosting dashboard
6. **Configure Fathom webhook** with production URL

### Enhance the System

1. **Add more prompt templates** via Prompts page
2. **Upload your example documents** via Examples page
3. **Configure deep research** (set `OPENAI_DEEP_RESEARCH_ENABLED=true`)
4. **Add Tavily API key** for fallback web search
5. **Customize deliverable types** in classification logic

### Monitor and Maintain

1. **Check Logs page** regularly for job status
2. **Review Prisma Studio** for database insights
3. **Monitor Redis memory** usage
4. **Track OpenAI API costs** in OpenAI dashboard
5. **Backup database** regularly (Prisma migrations + data)

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check this guide thoroughly
2. Review error messages in terminal
3. Check Logs page in the app
4. Verify all environment variables are set
